In order to use this extension you need to have the Calendar Base (cal) extension installed and running.
The typoscript template needs to have the static ics template included and configured.

The CalDAV extension can be installed through the typical TYPO3 installation process using the Extension Manager.

Define the pid's containing your frontend user and the calendar record in the extension options:
